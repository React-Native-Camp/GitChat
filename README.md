# GitChat

GitChat is a react native chatting application built as an extension of Github, to make developers' life easier by creating a way to connect them with each other on the Github platform, which would make their job easier and more efficient.

<br/>

# Motivation

As developers and Github users ourselves, we noticed that we always needed a second app to communicate on while using Github and we didn't want to keep distracting ourselves with so many apps and lose time, effort, and focus while jumping between those apps, so we decided to make a chatting app for Github to make our project development process easier, more focused, and have the development planning and code at the same place.

## User Journey

- `As a user` of the Github platform that can't chat directly on it.

- `I want to` use GitChat to communicate with other users on Github, whether I worked with them before on the platform or not.

- `So that` I have the chatting feature on Github itself and I don't get distracted with using another app to communicate with the people working with me on a Github project. I want it all to be in the same place. It would save me time and effort and make my job easier.

## User Story

- **As a user**, I expect to see a landing page with the app's logo and name for a few seconds, then be directed to the next page.

- **As a user**, I expect to see a login page that gives me the two options, either to sign in with Github if I have an account, or to click on a link that directs me to the Github sign up page.

- **As a user**, I expect to be directed to a page with multiple tabs after I sign in. The default tab I'll land on is the chatting tab which will have a `header` that displays the `app's logo` and the `app's name` on the left, in the middle section of the screen there will be a `sad lonely octocat image` and a `start a new chat button` if the person doesn't have previous chats, at the bottom section of the screen there will be a `navigation bar` that will include -along with the `chat option`-, a `contacts option` and a `profile option`.

- **As a user**, I expect to click on the `start a new chat button` and be directed to the `contacts` tab, which will include the same `header`, a `search bar` to search for other Github users, a `list of contacts (which are the people you follow, the people that are with you in the same organizations, and the people you worked with on the same repositories)`, and a ` group chat icon` to create group chats from.

- **As a user**, I expect to be able to chat with the person I click on, whether they are in the contacts list or they are a result of the search I will be doing using the `search bar`.

- **As a user**, I expect to get the correct search result when I search for a user on Github using the `search bar` in the contacts screen.

- **As a user**, I expect to be able to create a group chat when I click on the `group chat icon` in the contacts screen.

- **As a user**, I expect to be directed to another screen that includes a `header`, a `search bar`, `my contacts list` with a `plus icon` to be able to add them to a group chat of my choosing then click the `done button`.

- **As a user**, I expect to be directed to another page after I click the `done button`, which shows a pop-up asking me to choose a name for my group chat then confirm by clicking the `done button`, which then will direct me to the group chat I created.

- **As a user**, I expect to be able to `text-chat` with the group members I chose, along with sending them `voice notes` by clicking on the `microphone icon` in the footer, send them `attachments` by clicking the `paper clip icon` in the footer and `voice call` them using the `phone icon` on the header.

- **As a user**, I expect to click on the `profile button` on the main screen and be redirected to my profile on github.
